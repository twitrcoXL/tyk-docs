## <a name="analytics"></a>Analytics

Tyk has two types of analytics:

1. Per request. Per request stats contains info about each request, like path or status, it is also possible to enable “detailed request logging” where it will log base64 encoded data.
2. Aggregate. Aggregate statistics, aggregated by hour, and for the following keys: `APIID`, `ResponseCode`, `APIVersion`, `APIKey`, `OauthID`, `Geo`, `Tags` and `TrackPath`.

When you make a request to the gateway, it creates analytics records and puts it into a temporary Redis list, which is synced (and then flushed after sync) every 10 seconds by the Tyk Pump. The Pump processes all synced analytic records, and forwards them to configured pumps. By default, to make the Tyk Dashboard work, there are 2 pumps: `mongo` (per request) and `mongo_aggregate` (for aggregate). 

## <a name="redis"></a>Redis
The average single request analytics record (without detailed logging turned on) is around 1kb.

In terms of Redis, in addition to key storage itself, it should be able to hold the last 10 seconds of analytics data, preferably more, in case of a Tyk pump failure. So if you have 100 requests per second, you will need approximately 6MB for storing 60 seconds of data. Be aware that if detailed logging is turned on, this can grow by a magnitude of 10. 

> MDCB and Hybrid clients, instead of writing data to a temporary Redis list, sends it directly to the MDCB server, which processes them similar to Pump.

## <a name="mongodb"></a>MongoDB
The aggregate record size depends on the number of APIs and Keys you have. Each counter size ~ 50b, and every aggregated value has its own counter. 

So an hourly aggregate record is computed like: 50 * active_apis + 50 * api_versions + 50 * active_api_keys  + 50 * oauth_keys, etc. 

The average aggregate record size (created hourly), on our cloud it is ~ 40kb (single record include all the aggregate stats mentioned above).

So for 1 million requests per day, it will generate 1kb * 1M request stats (1gb) + 24 * 40kb aggregate stats (~1mb).

Per month: 30gb request logs + 30MB aggregate logs

## <a name="working"></a>MongoDB Working Data

Working data in terms of MongoDB is the data you query most often. The graphs displayed on the Dashboard, except for the Log browser, use aggregated data. 

So if you rely only on this kind of analytics, you will not experience issues with working data and memory issues. It is literally hundreds of MBs. 

Even if you use the Log browser, its usage access is usually quite random, and it is unlikely that you check requests for every request. So it can’t be called working data. And it is ok to store it on disk, and allow MongoDB to do the disk lookups to fetch the data. 

Note, that in order to do fast queries, even from the disk, MongoDB uses indexes. MongoDB recommends that indexes should fit into memory, and be considered working data, but only the part of the index which is commonly used. For example the last month of data. 

For an aggregate collection, the average index size is 6% from the overall collection. For requests stats it is around 30%. 


## <a name="example"></a>Example
if you serve 1M requests per day, and require fast access to the last seven days of request logs (usually way less, and the performance of the log viewer is not a concern), with 3 months of aggregated logs, the memory requirements for Mongo can be as follows:

Request_logs_index ( 30% * (1GB * 7) ) + aggregated(3month * 30mb) ~= 2.1GB + 90MB = ~ 2.2GB

In addition to storing working data in memory, MongoDB also requires space for some internal data structures. In general multiplying the resulting number by 2x should be enough. In the above example, your MongoDB server should have around 4.4 GB of available memory.
